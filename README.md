## Nice poem

Bartek, the coder, a legend, they say,
Crafts perfect frontends all night and all day.
With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript flair,
He builds the web with meticulous care.

Angular, React, or maybe Vue,
No framework’s too hard for him to pursue.
His designs are sleek, his layouts sublime,
Each pixel in place, each function on time.

But when work is done, he switches the gear,
Hops in his Tesla, futuristic and clear.
Silent it glides, on highways it hums,
A flash of the future wherever it comes.

Bartek in the driver’s seat, king of his game,
In code and in life, he’s earned his fame.
Frontend genius, electric thrill,
Bartek’s the one who’s got all the skill!
